# Learning Log: Review a slide presentation

## This deck is incomplete and each slide might have room for improvement.

Use your knowledge of presentations to ask yourself: What do you like about each slide? How would you improve each slide? To help guide your review, consider the following best practices for slide decks:

* Include a title, subtitle, and date

* Use a logical sequence of slides

* Provide an agenda with a timeline

* Limit the amount of text on slides. Your audience should be able to scan each block of text on your slides within 5 seconds

* Start with the business task. Focus on the business task and frame the information in the context of the business task.

* Establish the initial hypothesis

* Show what business metrics you used

* Use visualizations

* Introduce the graphic by name

* Provide a title for each graph

* Go from the general to the specific

* Use speaker notes to help you remember talking points

* Include key takeaways

# Messy data presentation

* No story or logical flow

* No titles

* Too much text

* Inconsistent format (no theme)

* No recommendation or conclusion at the end
