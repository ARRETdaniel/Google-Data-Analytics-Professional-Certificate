## Manually create a data frame

Coming up in the next video, you are going to learn how to transform data in R. The video will be using manually entered data instead of a data set from an R package.

If you would like to follow along with the video in your own RStudio console, you can copy and paste the following code to enter the data and create a data frame:

```{r}
id <- c(1:10)

name <- c("John Mendes", "Rob Stewart", "Rachel Abrahamson", "Christy Hickman", "Johnson Harper", "Candace Miller", "Carlson Landy", "Pansy Jordan", "Darius Berry", "Claudia Garcia")

job_title <- c("Professional", "Programmer", "Management", "Clerical", "Developer", "Programmer", "Management", "Clerical", "Developer", "Programmer")

employee <- data.frame(id, name, job_title)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
print(employee)
separate(employee, name, into = c("first_name", "last_name"), sep = " ")
```
Then, you can perform the functions from the video in your own console to practice transforming and cleaning data in R! Practicing along with the video will help you explore how these functions are supposed to work while also executing them yourself. You can also use this data frame to practice more after the video.
