## Filters and facets solutions
This document  contains the solutions for the filters and facets activity. You can use these solutions to check your work and ensure that your code is correct or troubleshoot your code if it is returning errors. If you haven't completed the activity yet, we suggest you go back and finish it before reading the solutions.

If you experience errors, remember that you can search the internet and the RStudio community for help:

## Step 1: Import your data

The data in this example is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191), written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020 (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md).

You can learn more about the dataset here:
https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

Run the code below to read in the file 'hotel_bookings.csv' into a data frame:

```{r}
hotel_bookings <- read.csv("hotel_bookings.csv")
```

## Step 2: Refresh Your Memory

By now, you are pretty familiar with this data set. But you can refresh your memory with the `head()` and `colnames()` functions. Run two code chunks below to get at a sample of the data and also preview all the column names:

```{r look at data}
head(hotel_bookings)
```

```{r look at column names}
colnames(hotel_bookings)
```

## Step 3: Install and load the 'ggplot2' package (optional)

If you haven't already installed and loaded the `ggplot2` package, you will need to do that before you can use the `ggplot()` function. You only have to do this once though, not every time you call `ggplot()`.

You can also skip this step if you haven't closed your RStudio account since doing the last activity. If you aren't sure, you can run the code chunk and hit 'cancel' if the warning message pops up telling you that have already downloaded the `ggplot2` package.

Run the code chunk below to install and load `ggplot2`. This may take a few minutes!

```{r loading and installing ggplot2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

## Step 4: Making many different charts

As a refresher, here's the scatter plot you created earlier.

```{r creating a plot}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lead_time, y = children))
```

You decide to create a bar chart showing each hotel type and market segment. You use different colors to represent each market segment:

```{r bar chart}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = hotel, fill = market_segment))
```

You decide to use the facet_wrap() function to create a separate plot for each market segment:

```{r faceting a plot}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = hotel)) +
  facet_wrap(~market_segment)
```

## Step 5: Filtering

For the next step, you will need to have the `tidyverse` package installed and loaded. You may see a pop-up asking if you want to install; if that's the case, click 'Install.' This may take a few minutes!

If you already have done this because you're using the`tidyverse` package on your own, you can skip this code chunk.

```{r install and download tidyverse}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

Use the `filter()` function to create a data set that only includes the data you want:

```{r filtering a dataset to just city hotels that are online TA}
onlineta_city_hotels <- filter(
  hotel_bookings,
  (hotel == "City Hotel" &
    hotel_bookings$market_segment == "Online TA")
)
```

You can use the`View`() function to check out your new data frame:

```{r View}
View(onlineta_city_hotels)
```

You can use the pipe operator (%>%) to do this in steps!

You name this data frame `onlineta_city_hotels_v2`:

```{r filtering a dataset with the pipe}
onlineta_city_hotels_v2 <- hotel_bookings %>%
  filter(hotel == "City Hotel") %>%
  filter(market_segment == "Online TA")
```

This code chunk generates the same data frame by using the `View()` function:

```{r view second dataframe}
View(onlineta_city_hotels_v2)
```

## Step 6: Use your new dataframe

Using the code for your previous scatterplot, replace `variable_name` in the code chunk below with either `onlineta_city_hotels` or `onlineta_city_hotels_v2` to plot the data your stakeholder requested:

```{r creating a plot part two}
ggplot(data = onlineta_city_hotels) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lead_time, y = children))
```
