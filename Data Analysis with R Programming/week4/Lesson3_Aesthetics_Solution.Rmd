## Aesthetics and visualizations activity solutions

This document  contains the solutions for the aesthetics and visualizations activity. You can use these solutions to check your work and ensure that your code is correct or troubleshoot your code if it is returning errors. If you haven't completed the activity yet, we suggest you go back and finish it before reading the solutions.

If you experience errors, remember that you can search the internet and the RStudio community for help:

## Step 1: Import your data
If you haven't exited out of RStudio since importing this data last time, you can skip these steps. Rerunning these code chunks won't affect your console if you want to run them just in case, though.

The data in this example is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191), written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020 (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md).

You can learn more about the dataset here:
https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

Run the code below to read in the file 'hotel_bookings.csv' into a data frame:

```{r}
hotel_bookings <- read.csv("bookings.csv")
```

## Step 2: Refresh Your Memory

By now, you are pretty familiar with this data set. But you can refresh your memory with the `head()` and `colnames()` functions. Run two code chunks below to get at a sample of the data and also preview all the column names:

```{r look at data}
head(hotel_bookings)
```

```{r look at column names}
colnames(hotel_bookings)
```

## Step 3: Install and load the 'ggplot2' package (optional)

Run the code chunk below to install and load `ggplot2` if you don't have it installed and loaded already. This may take a few minutes!

```{r loading and installing ggplot2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

## Step 4: Making a Bar Chart

Previously, you used `geom_point` to make a scatter plot comparing lead time and number of children. Now, you will use `geom_bar` to make a bar chart in this code chunk:

```{r example chart}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel))
```

## Practice quiz

Use the bar chart you created to answer this question: what distribution type has the most number of bookings? Note your answer and respond in the Coursera platform.

A: TA/TO
B: Direct
C: GDS
D: Corporate
Answer: A. The TA/TO distribution type has the most number of bookings.

## Step 5: Diving deeper into bar charts

After exploring your bar chart, your stakeholder has more questions. Now they want to know if the number of bookings for each distribution type is different depending on whether or not there was a deposit or what market segment they represent.

Try running the code below to answer the question about deposits. You will use 'fill=deposit_type' to accomplish this.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel, fill = deposit_type))
```

Now try running the code below to answer the question about different market segments. You will use 'fill=market_segment' to accomplish this.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel, fill = market_segment))
```
## Step 6: Facets galore

After reviewing the new charts, your stakeholder asks you to create separate charts for each deposit type and market segment to help them understand the differences more clearly.

Run the code chunk below to create a different chart for each deposit type:
```{r creating a plot}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel)) +
  facet_wrap(~deposit_type)
```

Run the code chunk below to create a different chart for each market segment:
```{r creating a plot}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel)) +
  facet_wrap(~market_segment)
```

The `facet_grid` function does something similar. The main difference is that `facet_grid` will include plots even if they are empty. Run the code chunk below to check it out:

```{r creating a plot}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel)) +
  facet_grid(~deposit_type)
```

Now, you could put all of this in one chart and explore the differences by deposit type and market segment.

Run the code chunk below to find out; notice how the ~ character is being used before the variables that the chart is being split by:
```{r creating a plot}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = distribution_channel)) +
  facet_wrap(~deposit_type ~ market_segment)
```
