## You and ggplot solutions
This document  contains the solutions for the you and ggplot activity. You can use these solutions to check your work and ensure that your code is correct or troubleshoot your code if it is returning errors. If you haven't completed the activity yet, we suggest you go back and finish it before reading the solutions.

If you experience errors, remember that you can search the internet and the RStudio community for help:

## Step 1: Import your data

The data in this example is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191), written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020 (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md).

You can learn more about the dataset here:
https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

In the chunk below, you will use the `read_csv()` function to import data from a .csv in the project folder called "hotel_bookings.csv" and save it as a data frame called `hotel_bookings`:

```{r load data}
hotel_bookings <- read.csv("hotel_bookings.csv")
```
## Step 2: Look at a sample of your data

Use the head() function to preview your data:
```{r examining your data}
head(hotel_bookings)
```

You can also use colnames() to get the names of all the columns in your data set. Run the code chunk below to find out the column names in this data set:

```{r look at column names}
colnames(hotel_bookings)
```

## Step 3: Install and load the 'ggplot2' package

If you haven't already installed and loaded the `ggplot2` package, you will need to do that before you can use the `ggplot()` function.

Run the code chunk below to install and load `ggplot2`. This may take a few minutes.

```{r loading and installing ggplot2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)
```

## Step 4: Begin creating a plot

You can use `ggplot2` to determine if people with children book hotel rooms in advance. Try running the code below:

```{r creating a plot}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = lead_time, y = children))
```

On the x-axis, the plot shows how far in advance a booking is made, with the bookings furthest to the right happening the most in advance. On the y-axis it shows how many children there are in a party.

## Step 5: Try it on your own

Try mapping 'stays_in_weekend_nights' on the x-axis and 'children' on the y-axis by filling out the remainder of the code below:

```{r}
ggplot(data = hotel_bookings) +
 geom_point(mapping = aes(x = stays_in_weekend_nights, y = children))
```
