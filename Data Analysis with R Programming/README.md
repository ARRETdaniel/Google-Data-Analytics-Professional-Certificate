### Data analyst

A data analyst collects, transforms, and organizes data to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making. The most popular programming languages used by data analysts are R and Python.

R offers convenient statistical features for data analysis and is useful for creating advanced data visualizations. Check out these resources to learn more about R:

- [ggplot2 - ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

### ggplot2 - Aesthetic attributes


- [Data visualization with ggplot2 cheat sheet: RStudio’s cheat sheet is a great reference to use while working with ggplot2. It has tons of helpful information, including explanations of how to use geoms and examples of the different visualizations that you can create.](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

- [Stats Education’s Introduction to R: This resource is a great way to learn the basics of ggplot2 and how to apply aesthetic attributes to your plots. You can return to this tutorial as you work more with ggplot2 and your own data.](http://statseducation.com/Introduction-to-R/modules/graphics/aesthetics/)

- [RDocumentation aes function: This guide describes the syntax of the aes function and explains what each argument does.](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.3.3/topics/aes)

- [Smoothing section in the Stats Education’s Introduction to R course. It includes detailed descriptions and examples of how to use the different types of smoothing in ggplot2. It also includes links to other lessons about ggplot2. You can explore these to get more familiar with plotting data in R.](http://statseducation.com/Introduction-to-R/modules/graphics/smoothing/)

- [*Putting it all together: (dplyr+ggplot):* The RLadies of Sydney’s course on R uses real data to demonstrate R functions. This lesson focuses specifically on combining dplyr and ggplot to filter data before plotting it. The instructional video will guide you through every step in the process while you follow along with the data they have provided.](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/03-vizwhiz-1/#1-4-putting-it-all-together-dplyr-ggplot)
